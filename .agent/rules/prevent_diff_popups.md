CRITICAL UI RULE:

Do not automatically expand the file change list or trigger the "Apply" UI tray.

After completing a task, provide a text-based summary of the files you modified in the chat.

Only present the formal "Accept All" diff view if I explicitly ask you to "show the diffs."

Keep all file changes in a minimized state in the status bar.
